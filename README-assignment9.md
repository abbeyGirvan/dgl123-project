# assignment 9

this assignment involved removing any uses of hardcoding pathnames, however my project doesn't involve any hardcoded pathnames outside the project.

Example given: /dgl123/project/index.php becomes $proj_root."index" but all of my path names already just just (name).php

This set up has worked for me because I do not have a router system like the laracast videos use. For most of the semester any code using the router system would either break or just not display for me, so I did not implement it. I also do not have a strong understanding of how this fuctionality works, so wasn't able to implement it.

As my code doesn't make use of subfolder pathnames outside the project files I was unsure of was to and unable to implement the $proj_root and $_SERVER instructions of the assignment. 

I did work with branching and merging here, just in adding this file. Good GitHub practice I suppose.

**NOTE** 

*the last instruction on brightspace says to include a screenshot of imgd.ca with the assignment. Not sure what this is refering to, as I do not see anywhere in this assignment in which we're meant to use AWS.*
