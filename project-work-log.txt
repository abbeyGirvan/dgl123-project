Css snippet improvements: syntax errors, switch to use of flex: 1; line 170, switch align-content to align items line 167
 
Improvements to <form> element of create.php:
      1.        Implement Proper Form Handling: Add an appropriate action attribute to the form to specify where to send the form data for processing.
      2.        Use Semantic HTML Elements: Utilize appropriate HTML elements to enhance the structure and semantics of the page.
      3.        Improve Accessibility: Include for attributes in labels to associate them with the corresponding input elements, enabling users to click on the label to select the associated input.
      4.        Fix Duplicate IDs: Ensure that each HTML element has a unique id attribute to prevent conflicts and ensure proper functionality.
 
 
To add dynamic functionality to your PHP page, you can utilize server-side scripting and various PHP functionalities to handle form submission, store data, and display dynamic content. Here are some suggestions to enhance the functionality:

      1.        Form Submission Handling: Create a PHP script, such as process.php, to handle the form submission. You can use PHP superglobals like $_POST to retrieve form data and perform necessary actions, such as storing the data in a database or a file.
      2.        Input Validation: Implement form validation on the server side to ensure that the submitted data is valid and safe to process. You can check for empty fields, validate the date format, and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
      3.        Database Integration: If you want to store the submitted data persistently, consider integrating a database like MySQL or SQLite. Use PHP's database functions (e.g., PDO or MySQLi) to establish a connection, insert data, or retrieve information from the database.
      4.        Displaying Dynamic Content: Fetch and display dynamic content from a database or any external source. You can use PHP to dynamically generate HTML content based on the data retrieved from the database.
                        
To organize the 'big-content' class more efficiently, you can consider using a more semantically appropriate HTML structure such as <table>. This will not only enhance the accessibility and maintainability of the code but also ensure that the content is properly structured for better display and understanding.

ASKED CHATGPT FOR SUGGESTIONS ON SETTING UP USER LOGIN:
To add a login page to your project, you will need to implement a user authentication system. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you get started:
    1.	    Create a Login Page: Design and create a login page (e.g., login.php) with input fields for username and password, along with a submit button.
    2.	    Set Up a Database: Create a database to store user credentials securely. Include a table for users that has fields for username and password.
    3.	    PHP Script for Authentication: Create a PHP script (e.g., auth.php) to handle user authentication. Use the PHP password_hash() function to hash passwords before storing them in the database, and the password_verify() function to verify passwords during login.
    4.	    Secure Session Management: Use PHP's session_start() function to initiate a session upon successful authentication. Set session variables to store user data or access levels.
    5.	    Redirect Users: After successful login, redirect users to the main page of your project. If the login fails, display an appropriate error message.



PEER FEEDBACK - SUMMARIZED BY CHATGPT:
                        
    1.	        User Rights and Task Management: Consider defining user rights for task assignment, addition, and deletion, both for personal and other users' tasks. It is important to clarify user control and task assignment to ensure smooth project management.
        NOTE: can be applied after implementing user database

    2.	        Detailed Project Description: Provide a more detailed project description to offer a comprehensive understanding of the project's objectives and functionalities.
    3.	        Mobile Responsiveness: Address mobile responsiveness to ensure that the website is easily accessible and usable across different devices and screen sizes.
    4.	        Clarification of Task Assignment: Clarify the process of task assignment, ensuring that it is intuitive and straightforward for all users.
       NOTE: some updated wireframing needed to work through this?

    5.	        Styling Plans: Discuss the styling plans for the project to ensure a consistent and appealing visual design that enhances user experience.
    6.         	Alignment and Consistency: Ensure proper alignment and consistency in the website layout for a more polished and professional appearance.
    7.	        Radio Button Size Consistency: Address the inconsistency in the size of radio buttons for improved visual consistency.
    8.	        Code Organization: Organize the code effectively to enhance readability and maintainability. Additionally, consider implementing an admin role that can assign tasks to different users for better task management.
