## STATUS:

**W.I.P.** Milestone 3

1. Database creation and linkage
2. Basic web app functionality
3. Flow Diagrams for logic

This milestone focuses on generating a working prototype for your target app.  While your app may be rough, most functionality should be in place and demonstrable.  This milestone will include techniques and contributions from weekly assignments as well -- please only evaluate your work here that isn't an exact duplicate of weekly assignments.

For this milestone, you'll need to connect your front end components to the back-end and integrate your database functionality. 

**Completed** Milestone 2

1. Finalize your design
2. Identify your target file structure
3. Implement HTML/CSS/PHP sufficiently to present your interface

This milestone focuses on the design and implementation of the UI elements for your semester project.  That means you'll be completing 1/2 of the build (the front-end build) by producing the UI elements corresponding to your Milestone 1 sketches and wireframes.  That also means the back-end is still somewhat undecided. 

The outcome should be a working interface, in the sense that it's rendered via PHP in a web browser.  You can expect to dummy up an interaction to show the screens as if a user were logged in, for example, by supplying mock data that will later come from a database.
