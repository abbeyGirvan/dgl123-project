dgl 123 final project

## STATUS:

Currently Completed Milestone 2

1. Finalize your design
2. Identify your target file structure
3. Implement HTML/CSS/PHP sufficiently to present your interface

This milestone focuses on the design and implementation of the UI elements for your semester project.  That means you'll be completing 1/2 of the build (the front-end build) by producing the UI elements corresponding to your Milestone 1 sketches and wireframes.  That also means the back-end is still somewhat undecided. 

The outcome should be a working interface, in the sense that it's rendered via PHP in a web browser.  You can expect to dummy up an interaction to show the screens as if a user were logged in, for example, by supplying mock data that will later come from a database.
